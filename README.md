You can ...

- Try 3 different levels:
  A cool music app has 3 different levels, Easy, Intermediate, and Hard.

- What are the differences:

  - For enthusiastic beginners, 2 random notes will be played only upwards to help you guess the answer.
  - There is an unlimited number of getting hints for you to listen to full scale between 2 notes

  - For intermediate-level players with basic skills, 2 random notes will be played either upwards or downwards
  - There is a limited number of hints

  - For skilled musicians, 2 random notes will be played TOGETHER
  - There is no hint available.

- Review and follow your progress:
  - After each quiz set, you can review which questions you got wrong and listen to them again!
  - Check your highest score and the average score of previously played games.
  - Check your weakness by reviewing the most wrong interval types.

## Scripts

### Development

1. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` to start the development server. The project files will be served at port `8080`, and can be viewed by navigating to `localhost:8080` in your web browser.

A pre-commit hook will automatically lint and format staged `.js` files in the `/src` directory.

### Production

To build the project, run:
`npm run build`
