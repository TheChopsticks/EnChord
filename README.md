(name of the app to be updated)
A cool music app is a perfect tool to develop your music dictation skills. Challenge yourself with different levels of quizzes and follow your progress by checking your average test results and highest score, and reviewing frequently mistaken interval types.

## How it works

(screenshots to be attached)
You can ...

- Try 3 different levels:
  A cool music app has 3 different levels, Easy, Intermediate, and Hard.

What are the differences: - For enthusiastic beginners, 2 random notes will be played only upwards to help you guess the answer. - There is an unlimited number of getting hints for you to listen to full scale between 2 notes

    - For intermediate-level players with basic skills, 2 random notes will be played either upwards or downwards
    - There is a limited number of hints

    - For skilled musicians, 2 random notes will be played TOGETHER
    - There is no hint available.

- Review and follow your progress:
  - After each quiz set, you can review which questions you got wrong and listen to them again!
  - You can review the top 3 average scores of the last 10 test results to follow your improvement.
