# Test Repo

The chopsticks are the best female developer duo.

## Scripts

### Development

1. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` to start the development server. The project files will be served at port `8080`, and can be viewed by navigating to `localhost:8080` in your web browser.

A pre-commit hook will automatically lint and format staged `.js` files in the `/src` directory.

### Production

To build the project, run:
`npm run build`
